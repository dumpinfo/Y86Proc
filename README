Y86 Processor Implementation for the Altera DE2-115

The overall design of the processor is pretty much the same. However, the
Fetch and Memory stages needed to be completely re-written and a few other
parts adjusted. This is because the SRAM component from the DE2-115 do not
satisfy the requirements of the original implementation, which are too
strong: It assumes a memory component with 8 banks, no alignment
restrictions, possibility of simultaneous read of instructions and data,
and the ability to entirely fetch the 48 bits of maximum instruction
length at once.
